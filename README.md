About Haiku You

Haiku you is an ember app that uses the third party api WordsApi to count syllables to make it easier for users to write a haiku.  It also generates them from a list of themes, which I wrote.  The front end uses regEx to take numbers and punctuation out of the haiku so that the wordApi can count the syllables.  Haiku are displayed using Handlebars and Bootstrap, in addition to HTML5 and CSS.

Given more time I would like to have the application verify that the poem fits the 5 - 7 - 5 structure before the user can publish the haiku.  I would also like to create an up and down voting system, so that highly voted haiku would be displayed first and low or negatively rated haiku would be removed from the publish section.
